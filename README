htscanner
=========
Description
-----------

When using a cgi version of php (plain old cgi or fast-cgi) apache can't pass
any php settings from htaccess files it parses. This can be solved by giving
each user it's own php.ini file, but I didn't like that solution.
This extension parses these configuration files (in most cases .htaccess) and
changes the settings. It will search all directories for a configuration file
from the docroot until the directory where the request scripts is found.

Note: When you don't load the mod_php module in apache, apache will give a 500
error when it finds an htaccess file with a php_* directive. You can prevent
this by using a diffirent file for php or by putting:
	<IfModule mod_php5.c>
		php_value	foo	bar
	</IfModule>
around the settings. This way apache will ignore them.

If for some reasons you like to allow your users to have .htaccess files
without <IfModule mod_php5.c>, you can use the mod_htscanner.c (Apache 1.x)
or mod_htscanner2.c (Apache 2.x) module provided with the package.

Install
-------

Make sure you have the development package installed if you installed
php from a binary package.

* Run phpize in the htscanner directory. Use the phpize script from the php
	version you wish to compile htscanner for.
* run the configure script the phpize created with --enable-htscanner
* run make
* run make install or copy the modules/htscanner.so file to the php
	extension directory
* copy the htscanner.ini configuration file to the php conf.d directory. If
	your php version doesn't support that (e.g. Suse) then you can
	add the settings from htscanner.ini to your php.ini
