TODO:

Support for all ini options
Requires either a merge or change the order of the init sections. As it
is technically possible, it requires some work on other extensions (like
session) and will break binary compatibility.
NB: it will be usefull for unicode to set the default enconding
NB#2: __NOT__ for the crappy flag


* ISP options

Add virtual host like options:

 * a config file to define the vhost options for a given path (virtual
   host)
   ex: open_basedir, safemode, tmp dir or disable_functions

 * list of allowed (or not allowed) options, like disable_functions but 
   for the ini settings.
   
These options are read and permanently cached at INIT (aka MINIT or 
sapi init) time and cached. What would rock is to have a 
`kill -HUP`-like to reload it without having to restart the server.

A possible solution could be to use a single file (same dir as ini_dir):
php.vhost.ini:
[/path/a/b/c]
option1 "abc"

[/path/a/b/d]
option1 "abcd"

[/path/a/b/e]
option1 "abcde"
